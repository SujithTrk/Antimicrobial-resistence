# Object detection of bacteria treated with antibiotics from microscopic images

Antibiotics are the primary drug for treating various kinds of infections occurring from bacteria and microbes.
They work mainly by blocking the vital pathway of those organisms and stopping them from multiplying. Previous
research shows that we can predict the antibiotics used on bacteria by visualizing its morphology. Here,
we present the object detection for detecting bacteria and identifying the antibiotics used on them.
